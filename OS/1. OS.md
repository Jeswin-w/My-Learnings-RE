## Introduction

An operating system (OS) manages and operates the system’s components.

It provides the environment for applications to run.

System Architecture

The OS is structured to manage hardware and software resources.

This lecture provides an overview of what the OS and kernel do.

## Kernel

The kernel is the core part of the OS.

It manages low-level operations such as memory, CPU scheduling, and device drivers.

The kernel provides the foundation on which higher-level tools and applications run.

OS gives gui for kernal

## Resources

Every system has limited resources (CPU, memory, storage, network).

The OS is responsible for managing and allocating these resources efficiently.

## CPU

The CPU is the execution unit where instructions are processed.

Multi-core processors allow parallel execution of processes. 

Each core has clock speed - instruction per clck cycle. 

The OS schedules processes across cores for efficiency.

## Cache

CPU caches (L1, L2, L3) store frequently used data close to the processor.
L3 is shared by all cores.
They improve speed but require synchronization across cores to avoid inconsistency.

Without synchronization the values of the variable can be pdated in one cache of a core and another core may have the wrong value

## Memory

RAM is volatile memory used to store active processes and data.

Data is not accessed sequentially.
RAM is volatile data lost on macine restart.

memory is limited. Slower than CPU caches.

The OS uses virtual memory to abstract and extend physical memory.

Virtual memory enables processes to use more memory than physically available.

## Storage

Persistent storage includes hard drives (HDD) and solid-state drives (SSD).

HDDs use magnetic storage; SSDs use flash memory.

SSDs are faster but have limited write cycles. for write it shoul invalidate pages to write new data.

slower than memory

## Network

The OS manages network communication through the Network Interface Controller (NIC).

Protocols such as TCP/IP are implemented in the OS kernel for efficiency.

## File System

A file system organizes data on storage devices into files and directories.

It abstracts physical storage blocks into logical structures.

Examples include ext4, NTFS, FAT32, and tmpfs.

## Program vs. Process

A program is a compiled executable stored on disk.

A process is a running instance of a program in memory.

Multiple processes can run from the same program.

## Process Management

The kernel schedules processes and threads on CPU cores.

It manages process execution, I/O operations, and resource allocation.

### User Space vs. Kernel Space

User space contains applications and their process data.
eg) browsers
Kernel space contains kernel code, device drivers, and system resources.
eg) tcp ip stack, kernal code

kernal and use space are isolated
iouring broke it - so security issues were found

System calls provide controlled interaction between user space and kernel space.

## Device Drivers

Device drivers are kernel modules(software) that control hardware components.

Examples: keyboard drivers, network drivers, disk drivers.

They translate hardware signals into OS-level operations.

## System Calls

System calls are the interface between user space and the kernel.

Examples include read, write, malloc, and process management functions.

Each call triggers a switch from user mode to kernel mode.

## Summary

The OS manages hardware resources and provides usability through tools.

The kernel handles core functions such as CPU scheduling, memory, storage, and networking.

Higher-level applications rely on kernel services to function.
