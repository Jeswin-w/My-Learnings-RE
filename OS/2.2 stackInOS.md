Stack

Stack is a Data structure, That is faster than heap

function's memory is stored in stack and the active stack is at the top of the stack. each function has a frame.

once it is executed the function is poped.

when memory is added the memory address decreases as memory written from high to low

stack size is limited

Stack pointer:

it is used to move to next memory in a stack frame
it is a cpu register
it allocates & deallocates meory
points at end (last memory)

Base pointer/frame pointer:

a static pointer that points to the first address of a stack frame

also a cpu register

the address pointed by bp is used to read the value of variables as it differs by a fixed byte

nested calls:

sp and bp will be on active function

when active func returns and terminates sp goes to end
