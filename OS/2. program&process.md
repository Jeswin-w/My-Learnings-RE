# program 

code is compiled and linked into a program

Static linking - one huge file with no libraries

dynamic uses pointers to call libraries

once compiled it wont get executed on other CPU arch

It lives on disk

# Process 
Process lives on memory

when a program is run it creates a process

each process has an ID

it has a stach , heap , data and code in memory

uses program counter -> it points to the next line of the code

Process control Block -> it gives information of the process, where is the pointer and other important information.
