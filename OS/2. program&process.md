# program 

code is compiled and linked into a program

Static linking - one huge file with no libraries

dynamic linkers uses pointers to call libraries

DLLs-dyamic linked library is usually used for dynamic linking

once compiled it wont get executed on other CPU arch as it is not compiled for this

It lives on disk

# Process 
Process lives on memory

Process has a minimum and maximum addresses -all process uses virtual memory . Stack, Heap , program code, data all lives in these addresses

The stack grows downward while heap grows upward

when a program is run it creates a process

each process has an ID
ID also has namespace for finding process in containerisation

uses program counter -> it points to the next line of the code

Process control Block -> it gives information of the process, where is the pointer and other important information like register. 

Updating and reading from the PCB is expensive
