Process is in memory
The code is in text area/code. It is read only.

One exception is JIT compilation in js and java in that case the code is in heap

1 core gets allocated to a process, on one exception is hyper threading (virtual thread) of intel cores


avg time cost
register 1 ns
l1 2 ns
l2 7 ns
l3 15 ns
memory 100 ns
ssd 150 micro s
hdd 10 milli sec


First the program counter store the address of first instruction (memory read), the elf header says what the first insruction is.

then instruction register loads the instruction of first instruction address (memory read)

the cpu understants the instruction and then executes the instruction.

now increment the pc - 4 byte for 32 bit, 8 for 64 bit

- caches make it so not exery instruction should be read from memory instead we read from l1 

after some calculation in cpu we need to write result to memory, this goes through all caches to store in a mem0ry address
