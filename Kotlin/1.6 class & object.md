# Kotlin Classes and Objects — Short Summary

This document is a shortened version of the Kotlin *Classes and Objects* guide from typealias.com.

---

## What Is a Class?

A class is a blueprint used to create objects.

```kotlin
class Person
```

An object is an instance of a class.

```kotlin
val person = Person()
```

---

## Properties

Classes can have properties.

```kotlin
class Person {
    var name: String = ""
    var age: Int = 0
}
```

Access properties using dot notation:

```kotlin
val person = Person()
person.name = "Alex"
person.age = 25
```

---

## Constructors

### Primary Constructor

```kotlin
class Person(val name: String, var age: Int)
```

Usage:

```kotlin
val person = Person("Alex", 25)
```

---

## Member Functions

Functions inside a class are called member functions.

```kotlin
class Person(val name: String) {
    fun greet() {
        println("Hello, my name is $name")
    }
}
```

---

## Objects

Objects hold state and behavior together.

```kotlin
val person = Person("Alex", 25)
person.greet()
```

---

## Summary

- Classes define structure
- Objects are class instances
- Properties store data
- Constructors initialize objects
- Member functions define behavior
