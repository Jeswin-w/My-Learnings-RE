# Kotlin Enum Classes — Short Summary

This document is a shortened and enhanced version of the Kotlin Enum Classes guide,
based on TypeAlias and official Kotlin documentation.

---

## What Is an Enum Class?

An enum class represents a fixed set of constant values.
Use enums when values are known in advance.

```kotlin
enum class Direction {
    NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST
}
```

Usage:

```kotlin
val dir = Direction.NORTH
println(dir)
```

---

## Enum with `when`

Enums work very well with `when` expressions.

```kotlin
fun move(direction: Direction) {
    when (direction) {
        Direction.NORTH -> println("Moving north")
        Direction.SOUTH -> println("Moving south")
        Direction.EAST  -> println("Moving east")
        Direction.WEST  -> println("Moving west")
    }
}
```

---

## Enum Properties

Enums can have constructor parameters.

```kotlin
enum class Status(val code: Int) {
    SUCCESS(200),
    ERROR(500),
    NOT_FOUND(404)
}
```

```kotlin
val s = Status.SUCCESS
println(s.code)
```

---

## Enum Functions

Enums can contain functions.

```kotlin
enum class PaymentMethod {
    CARD, CASH;

    fun isOnline(): Boolean {
        return this == CARD
    }
}
```

---

## Built-in Enum Properties

Every enum has:

```kotlin
val name = Direction.NORTH.name      // "NORTH"
val ordinal = Direction.NORTH.ordinal // 0
```

---

## Enum Utility Functions

```kotlin
val all = Direction.entries
val value = Direction.valueOf("NORTH")
```

---

## Why Use Enums?

- Type safety
- Readable code
- Prevents invalid values
- Works perfectly with `when`

---

## Summary

- Enums define a fixed set of constants
- Can have properties and functions
- Provide built-in utility methods
- Ideal replacement for constants or magic numbers
