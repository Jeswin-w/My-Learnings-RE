# Kotlin Collections – Notes (TypeAlias Summary)

## What are Collections?

Collections are used to store groups of values.
Kotlin provides rich collection APIs that are:
- Readable
- Immutable by default
- Functional in style

Main types:
- List
- Set
- Map

This chapter focuses on **List** and **Set**.

---

## Lists

### Creating Lists

Immutable list:

```kotlin
val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3)
```

Mutable list:

```kotlin
val mutableNumbers = mutableListOf(1, 2, 3)
mutableNumbers.add(4)
```

---

### Accessing Elements

```kotlin
numbers[0]
numbers.get(1)
```

---

### Adding and Removing Elements (Immutable Style)

```kotlin
val newList = numbers + 4
val removed = numbers - 2
```

Original list remains unchanged.

---

### Iterating Over Lists

```kotlin
numbers.forEach { println(it) }
numbers.forEach(::println)
```

---

## Collection Operations

### map

Transforms each element.

```kotlin
val doubled = numbers.map { it * 2 }
```

---

### filter

Keeps elements that match a condition.

```kotlin
val evens = numbers.filter { it % 2 == 0 }
```

---

### sorted

```kotlin
val sorted = numbers.sorted()
```

---

### Chaining Operations

```kotlin
numbers
    .map { it * 2 }
    .filter { it > 3 }
    .sorted()
```

---

## Sets

Sets store **unique elements**.

```kotlin
val set = setOf(1, 2, 2, 3)
println(set) // 1, 2, 3
```

Mutable set:

```kotlin
val mutableSet = mutableSetOf(1, 2)
mutableSet.add(3)
```

---

### Set Characteristics

- No duplicate values
- No index-based access
- Order is not guaranteed

---

### Converting Between List and Set

```kotlin
val list = listOf(1, 2, 2, 3)
val unique = list.toSet()
val backToList = unique.toList()
```

---

## Useful Collection Functions

```kotlin
numbers.take(2)
numbers.drop(1)
numbers.distinct()
numbers.reversed()
```

---

## Best Practices

- Prefer immutable collections (`listOf`, `setOf`)
- Use functional operations instead of loops
- Convert to mutable collections only when needed

---

## Common Mistakes

- Modifying immutable collections
- Using loops instead of built-in functions
- Expecting order in a Set

---

## Key Takeaways

- Kotlin collections are immutable by default
- Lists preserve order, Sets enforce uniqueness
- Collection operations are expressive and chainable
