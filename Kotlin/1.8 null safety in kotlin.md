# Kotlin Null Safety — Detailed Notes

This document provides detailed notes on **null handling in Kotlin**, based on the
TypeAlias Kotlin guide and official Kotlin documentation.

---

## 1. Why Null Safety Matters

In many languages (like Java), `null` is a common cause of runtime crashes
(`NullPointerException`). Kotlin was designed to **eliminate null errors at compile time**
as much as possible.

Kotlin achieves this using **nullable and non-nullable types**.

---

## 2. Non‑Nullable Types (Default)

By default, variables **cannot hold null**.

```kotlin
var name: String = "Kotlin"
// name = null ❌ Compile-time error
```

---

## 3. Nullable Types (`?`)

To allow `null`, you must explicitly mark the type with `?`.

```kotlin
var name: String? = "Kotlin"
name = null // ✅ allowed
```

---

## 4. Null Checks Using `if`

```kotlin
val name: String? = "Alex"

if (name != null) {
    println(name.length)
}
```

Kotlin smart-casts `name` to non-null inside the block.

---

## 5. Safe Call Operator (`?.`)

```kotlin
val name: String? = null
println(name?.length)
```

Returns `null` instead of crashing.

---

## 6. Elvis Operator (`?:`)

```kotlin
val name: String? = null
val length = name?.length ?: 0
println(length)
```

---

## 7. Not‑Null Assertion (`!!`)

```kotlin
val name: String? = null
println(name!!.length) // ❌ Runtime crash
```

Avoid using this unless absolutely sure.

---

## 8. Chained Safe Calls

```kotlin
val cityLength = user?.address?.city?.length
```

---

## 9. `let` with Nullable Values

```kotlin
val name: String? = "Kotlin"

name?.let {
    println(it.length)
}
```

---

## 10. Nullable Return Types

```kotlin
fun getUserName(): String? {
    return null
}
```

---

## 11. Platform Types (Java Interop)

Java types may appear as platform types (`String!`) in Kotlin and require caution.

---

## 12. Best Practices

- Prefer non-null types
- Use `?.` and `?:`
- Avoid `!!`
- Handle Java types carefully

---

## Summary

Kotlin null safety prevents most runtime crashes by enforcing explicit handling of nulls.
