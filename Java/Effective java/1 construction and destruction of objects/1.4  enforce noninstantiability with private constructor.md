# Non instantiability for Utils

utility classes were not designed to be instantiated: an instance would be nonsensical. 

In the absence of explicit constructors, however, the compiler provides a public, parameterless default constructor. 

Attempting to enforce noninstantiability by making a class abstract does not work. The class can be subclassed and the subclass instantiated. Furthermore,
it misleads the user into thinking the class was designed for inheritance.

A default constructor is generated only if a class contains no explicit constructors, so a class can be made noninstantiable by including a private constructor.

```java
// Noninstantiable utility class
public class UtilityClass {
    // Suppress default constructor for noninstantiability
    private UtilityClass() {
    throw new AssertionError();
    }
... // Remainder omitted
}
 ```
The assertion error is to make sure noone creates a object inside the class.

private constructor also doesn't allow it to be subclassed.
