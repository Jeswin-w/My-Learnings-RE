# Dependency Injecttion over hardcoding 

Never create a Util or a singleton for a class that uses another resource

eg) Spell check can be a Util but it can use different languages or dictionaries

So spell check can't be a singleton or a util

A simple pattern that satisfies this requirement is to pass the resource into the constructor when creating a new instance. This is one form of dependency injection: the dictionary is a dependency of the spell checker and is injected into the spell checker when it is created.

```java
// Dependency injection provides flexibility and testability
 public class SpellChecker {
    private final Lexicon dictionary;
    public SpellChecker(Lexicon dictionary) {
        this.dictionary = Objects.requireNonNull(dictionary);
    }
    public boolean isValid(String word) { ... }
    public List<String> suggestions(String typo) { ... }
 }
```

Imagine if a class wants to create multiple instance of another class. 

here we can inject a factory that creates many instances

```java
 Mosaic create(Supplier<? extends Tile> tileFactory) {
    Tile t1 = tileFactory.get();  
    Tile t2 = tileFactory.get();
    Tile t3 = tileFactory.get();
 }

 create(Tile::new);
 create(SpecialTile::new);

```

this can be done in a constructor too. this also allows us to send a subclass of tile if needed.
