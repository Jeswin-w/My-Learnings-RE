# Always Override `toString()` --- Effective Java Summary

## Why Override `toString()`?

-   Provides easy-to-read object descriptions.
-   Greatly improves debugging and logging.
-   Helps developers quickly understand object state.
-   Many frameworks call `toString()` implicitly.

## Guidelines for a Good `toString()`

-   Be concise yet informative.
-   Include key fields that describe the object.
-   Ensure the format is human-readable and self-explanatory.
-   Avoid exposing sensitive data.
-   Document the output format if used externally.

## When You May Skip Overriding

-   Utility classes with no instance data.
-   Purely static classes.
-   Internal helper classes with no meaningful object state.

## Conclusion

Always override `toString()` in classes that represent meaningful data
or domain values. It makes your code easier to debug, maintain, and
understand.
