# Spring MVC Overview

- **Model**  
  Contains the business logic and data.  
  Represented by Java classes that handle the core functionality and data of the application.

- **View**  
  Represents the user interface (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).  
  Responsible for displaying the data to the user.

- **Controller**  
  Acts as an intermediary between Model and View.  
  Processes user requests, executes business logic via the Model, and selects the appropriate View to render.
