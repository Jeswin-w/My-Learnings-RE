# Indexing

It is a data structure on top of Table to make queries faster

use `explain analyse` to see how queries work internally

```sql
select id from employees where id = 2000
```

this will be very fast because we only need to scan the index which is the Btree.

```sql
select name from employees where id = 2000
```

for this query we need to scan index to find id and then the table

this is cached when you do it next time

```sql
select id from employees where name = 'abc'
```

name column does not have a index so we scan full table sequentially

In PG we have workers so we scan parallely

```sql
select id from employees where name like '%abc%'
```

this is even slower

### Creating index : 
create index employees_name on employess(name);

now the same query will be quicker
```sql
select id from employees where name = 'abc'
```

but .. 
```sql
select id from employees where name like '%abc%'
``` 

will not scan the index cause we need the expression as index wont help here
