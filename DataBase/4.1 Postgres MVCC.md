# 🔄 Why PostgreSQL Creates a New Row on UPDATE

PostgreSQL creates a **new row on UPDATE** due to its use of **MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)** — a concurrency model that ensures **readers don’t block writers and writers don’t block readers**.

---

## 📌 How It Works

When you run an `UPDATE`, PostgreSQL:

1. Marks the old row as dead (not immediately deleted).  
2. Inserts a new version of the row with updated values.  
3. Updates indexes to point to the new row (which has a new `ctid`).  

---

## 🧠 The Purpose: MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)

MVCC enables:

- Readers to see a **consistent snapshot** of data (without locking).  
- Writers to update data **without blocking readers**.

Instead of modifying a row in-place (which might block or confuse concurrent transactions):

- PostgreSQL creates a **new row version**.  
- The old version is still visible to transactions that started before the update.

---

## 🧪 Example

Suppose you run:

UPDATE users SET name = 'Alice' WHERE id = 1;

PostgreSQL will:

- Insert a new row with `name = 'Alice'`.  
- Mark the old row as dead.  
- Update all indexes to point to the new row’s `ctid`.

---

## 🧹 What Removes the Old Row?

- Autovacuum or manual `VACUUM` reclaims space used by dead rows.  
- This is essential to:  
  - Prevent **table and index bloat**.  
  - Keep **query performance** high.

---

## ⚠️ Side Effects

- All indexes must be updated since the `ctid` changes.  
- Frequent updates on large tables can lead to:  
  - Table bloat (many dead tuples).  
  - Increased I/O if autovacuum can't keep up.

## 🆚 Comparison with Other Databases

| Database       | UPDATE Behavior                  | Index Target      |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|
| PostgreSQL     | Inserts a new version (MVCC)      | `ctid`            |
| MySQL (InnoDB) | Updates in-place (undo logs used) | Primary Key       |
| SQL Server     | Updates in-place or moves rows    | Row ID / Slot     |

---

## ✅ Summary

- PostgreSQL creates a new row on update to maintain **non-blocking concurrency** using MVCC.  
- It ensures **transactional consistency** without needing locks.  
- Index updates and vacuuming are essential to keeping performance optimal.
