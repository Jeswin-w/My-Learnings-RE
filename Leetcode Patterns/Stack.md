Do I need to look forward or backward to find something "greater" or "smaller"?

Can elements be pushed/popped based on a strict order (like increasing or decreasing)?

Am I comparing the current element with a previous one to decide what to do?

Can I discard previous elements once a new one invalidates them?

monotonic stack -> increasing or decreasing order maintained in stack
