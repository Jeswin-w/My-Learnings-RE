## Techniques to solve arrays and hashing

Dealing with alphabet Strings

we can always use hashmap but if the input only has upper/ lower case letters then we can use a array of size 26

for lower case do ch - 97

for upper case do ch - 65

these are the asciis of a and A rspectively.

using this we can save space

### Anagrams

sorting a char arrar then the strings should be the same
