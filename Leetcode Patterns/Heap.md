## MIN & MAX HEAPS 

if the questing is like find top n or bottom n use heaps

top n frequest words

1. count frequency.
2. Create heap of size n

in Java we use priority queue to create a heap

The advantage of this over sorting a hashmap is we need to sort only small data is size is huge this is efficient 

this can be better done my bucket sort.
